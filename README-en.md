The terminal software most used on `MAC` is `item2`, but `item2` is inconvenient to connect to the server (remember the password). To configure `profile`, if you want to connect to multiple machines, you need to configure multiple `profiles`. If you want to add personalized Settings: background blur, font, etc., you need to modify each `profile`, which is very inconvenient.

This project through the establishment of the principle of the board jumper, support the selection of serial number to log in the machine.
